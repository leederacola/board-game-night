<h4>Whats up with it?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I started with Google Firebase Real Time Database for ease of use to get up and running with an Angular Project</li>
  <li>Now that my data model is a bit more complex, I have decided to switch to a .Net/SQL backend because thats what employers
    want in job descriptions.</li>
  <li>I enjoy Angular so I intend on developing a .Net Core API project so I can continue to use this application</li>
