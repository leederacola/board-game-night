<h4>Welcome to Board Game Night / Board Game Buddy</h4>
<h5>work in progress</h5>
<h5>What it does currently</h5>
<ul>
  <li><h4>side game list component generated from firebase database</h4></li>
  <li><h4>filtering with firebase queries</h4></li>
  <li>add players, click filter type(not accurate)</li>
  <li>clicking game link will display details component</li>


</ul>
<h3>Need to Fix</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Detail component still use hardcoded game ids- replace with db service</li>
  <li>need to combine player count filters without combining 2 seperate list</li>
  <li>Add Players to an event - players have games -added players filter avaiable games</li>
  <li>toggle event list - based on players games and count and total db games</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
